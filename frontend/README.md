# frontend
So many decisions.
* Does it make sense how I grab the id to delete and update teh task in the `Task` component?
* Should I move the handlers out of `Task` and `CreateTask` components? I think it is more clear if I leave them in there.

## todos
* implement update feature on front-end (maybe use getbyid and update on backend)
* validatation for the form
* some cool functionality would be to write a separate service that generates a google spreadsheet
* should I use reducers or something else to manage the form's state?

## interview answers
If an interview asks me how I am with React right now:
* I haven't used React in a while, but I was playing with it the other day, and I was a bit rusty but I'm still comfortable using it. I'm comfortable solving problems, and I knew where to look when I forgot something.
